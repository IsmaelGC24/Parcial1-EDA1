## 📖 Project Description
This project was developed as part of **Evaluation 01 – Practical Assignment (Moment 2)** for the course *Data Structures and Algorithms*.  

The goal is to implement and document solutions in **C++** using linear data structures, specifically **arrays and singly linked lists**.  

The repository contains the source code and documentation for the following exercises:  

- **Array Reversal**  
  - Function that receives an integer array and returns a new array with the elements in reverse order.  
  - Function to display the array elements in the console.  
  - Demonstration with different test cases (regular array, single-element array, repeated values).  

- **Ordered Insertion in a Singly Linked List**  
  - Singly linked list where each node contains an integer and a pointer to the next node.  
  - Function to insert nodes while maintaining ascending order.  
  - Function to display the list in the console.  
  - Additional function to free all dynamically allocated memory.  
  - Demonstration with several cases (empty list, insertion at the beginning, in the middle, at the end, and with repeated values).
