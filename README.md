University: EAFIT

##Introduction

This project was developed as part of Evaluation 01 – Practical Assignment (Moment 2) for the course Data Structures and Algorithms.

The main objective is to implement and document solutions in C++ using linear data structures, specifically arrays and singly linked lists.

The repository contains the source code and documentation related to the following exercises:

Array Reversal

Implement a function that receives an integer array and returns a new array with the elements in reverse order.

Implement a function to display the array elements in the console.

Demonstration with different test cases (regular array, single-element array, repeated values).

Ordered Insertion in a Singly Linked List

Implement a singly linked list where each node contains an integer and a pointer to the next node.

Implement a function to insert nodes while maintaining ascending order.

Implement a function to display the list in the console.

Add an additional function to free all dynamically allocated memory.

Demonstration with several cases (empty list, insertion at the beginning, in the middle, at the end, and with repeated values).

##Lenguage and environment

Language: C++

IDE/Environment: Visual Studio Code

Compiler: g++ or any compatible compiler supporting C++11 or later

##Test Cases

Arrays:

Regular array with multiple elements.

Array with a single element.

Array with repeated values.

Linked Lists:

Initially empty list.

Insertion at the beginning, in the middle, and at the end.

Insertion of repeated values.
